-------------------------------IMPORTANT------------------------------
From JpGraph 1.15 there has been a configuration change.

NOTE 1: All configuration defines has been moved from the file
'jpgraph.php' to a new separate file 'jpg-config.inc'

NOTE 2: IconPlots has been moved to a separate file 
jpgraph_iconplot.php which you must include if you plan on creating
IconPlots

NOTE 3: PlotBands have been moved to a separate file 
jpgraph_plotband.php which you must add to your scripts if you are 
using plotbands.
